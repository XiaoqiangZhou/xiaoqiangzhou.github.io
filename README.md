##### RESEARCH INTEREST
- Multimedia Information Retrieval
- Computer Vision 

##### EDUCATION
- B.E. Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, 2015-2019 

##### ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE

- Multimedia Computing & Communication Lab, Advisor: Prof. Wengang Zhou, 2017/09-2018/06
   - Research Project: Large-Scale Video Retrieval  
     I implement a retrieval method proposed by Andre Araujo. Besides, I retrain the parameters of GMM and expand it to video-to-video retrieval task
   - Experiment: Compare performance of SIFT and R-MAC in visual localization task  
     I record database video and query videos in my campus, while query videos are shorter and captured in a diﬀerent light or weather condition. Using SIFT and R-MAC descriptor as the image feature separately, I compare their performance on this task. 

- Research Intern: Internet Media Group, MSRA, Beijing, Mentor: Dr. Chong Luo.2018/07-2019/06
   - Demo: Video Synopsis  
     We use existed detector and tracker to extract tracklets. Later, tracklets are rearranged to reduce the video length, followed by image synthesis. This demo is selected into Microsoft TechFest 2019
   - Research Project: Visual Object Tracking  
     We propose to add more templates in tracking. Backward veriﬁcation is used to verify the correctness of template request. By the way, we ﬁnd a good indicator to enlarge search region. Results on several benchmarks are promising
